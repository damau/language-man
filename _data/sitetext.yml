    title: "About"
    text: "Little about me"
    paragraphs:
      - "I have been working in Bali, Indonesia as part of the hospitality industry for over 10 years. I have always loved language.  When I first started learning languages, the lessons were dry and I found it took a long time to be able to communicate on any level in the language.  I felt disheartened with all the work I put in not being able to go straight out and use it.  The acedemic way of learning a language is slow but accurate. So I decided ended up developing my method.  Especially as at times I had to learn or relearn a language really quickly."
      - "During the pandemic I turned my attention to teaching.  I started teaching some of the expats I knew.  They gave me encouragement and confirmed my method was not just for me."
      - "I have also been using some of the money I generate to provide free lessons to underpriveledged children in my area in Bali.  Teaching them English in the hope it can give them the leg up they need."

    title: "Methodology"
    text: "My language cheat sheets"
    paragraphs:
      - "My method is personalised to you and your abilities.  I tailor a program so that you can be talking, even in small amounts, as quickly as possible.  I write a lesson, at your level, that you can read through and go out and practice as quickly as possible.  The lessons are typically conversational until you start to find your feet in the language you choose to learn."
      - "This way you to 'hack' your way into a language. Making it fun, quick and easy. The other advantage of my 'cheat sheets' is that if you do not speak the language for a long time, you can simply read through them and it triggers all the memories and joy you had learning so it is always available to you and never a waste of time."

        testimony: "I am so bad at learning languages, but I thought I would give it ago after moving to Bali.  I started with Udin after a recommendation.  Despite being an awful student and not doing my homework I still found myself speaking a lot of Bahasa after maybe 15 lessons.  The first lesson was tough, the language tough initially, but after a few lessons with him a did get into a rythm and each lesson became easier and easier. I liked the way in which he taught so much, I made this website for him (forgive me I don't do UX/UI/Design :))"

        testimony: "I worked with Udin in the tourist industry.  I remember we had a large group of Russians coming and no one in the company knew any Russian.  Udin voluteered to learn, in 5 weeks he was proficient enough to manage each of their requests.  So I asked if he could teach me German.  The method works, but do follow it and trust him."
