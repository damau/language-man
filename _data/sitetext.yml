    paragraph: "I have been working in Bali, Indonesia as part of the hospitality industry for over 10 years. I have always loved language.  When I first started learning languages, the lessons were dry and I found it took a long time to be able to communicate on any level in the language.  I felt disheartened with all the work I put in not being able to go straight out and use it.  The acedemic way of learning a language is slow but accurate. My method allows you to 'hack' your way into a language. Making it fun, quick and easy.  The other advantage of my 'cheat sheets' is that if you do not speak the language for a long time, you can simply read through them and it triggers all the memories and joy you had learning so it is always available to you and never a waste of time."

    title: "Methodology"
    text: "My language cheat sheets"
    method-text: "My method is personalised to you and you abilities.  I tailor a program so that you can be talking, even in small amounts, as quickly as possible.  I write a lesson, at your level, that you can read through and go out and practice as quickly as possible.  The lessons are typically conversational until you start to find your feet in the language you choose to learn."
